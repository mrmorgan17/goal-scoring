Better Understanding Goal Scoring in Soccer Matches

In soccer, the obvious main objective is to score more goals than the opponent. Perhaps just as
obvious is that in order to score goals, a team must take shots. Although, what characteristics
about the shots that a team takes throughout a match determine how many goals are scored? This
question forms the basis of the first goal of this analysis which will be to find shot-specific variables
that can better explain the number of goals scored in a match.

Additionally, there is often much variation in goal scoring due to the teams that are playing. Some
of this variation is due to tactics. Teams may take a possession-based approach and are constantly
taking shots throughout the game while other teams may focus on maintaining a low defensive block,
soaking up pressure from the opposition, and taking their shots on counterattacks. Additionally,
some teams have higher quality players throughout their squad and as a result, the team does better
at taking higher quality shots throughout a match. Furthermore, the expected scoring output of a
team often varies from the actual scoring output of a team. For example, a team could have taken
20 shots in a game, have been expected to score 3 goals, and actually scored 1. Another team may
have only taken 7 shots, have been expected to score 1 goal, and actually scored 2. Given all these
considerations that will have to be made for teams, the second goal of this analysis will be to fit
a model that is able to account for the team-specific variation in goal scoring after accounting for
the shot-specific variables that have been identified as being able to better explain the number of
goals scored in a match.
